Instructions:

Compile Test.java (javac Test.java)
Run Test (java Test)


Output:
--------------------
ArrayQueue time: 43
LLQueue time: 24

--------------------
Analysis:

This shows that the LLQueue is slightly more efficient than the ArrayQueue.  
This makes sense since the SinglyLL data in a LLQueue has direct access to the head and tail elements, and can call methods directly from the SinglyLL data object.

--------------------
Bugs:

Can improve upon output and documentation
